# Genome-wide allele frequency studies in Pacific oyster families identify candidate genes for tolerance to ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1)
This repository contains the code used in a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09744-0) in the journal BMC Genomics.

Repository overview:
* SNP_pipeline.sh - Code to call and impute phased SNPs from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data of biparental families
* AlphaFamImpute_prep.R - Code to generate the input files for the AlphaFamImpute program
* GWAFS.R - Code to run genome-wide allele frequency studies (GWAFS)
